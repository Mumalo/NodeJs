console.log("Starting app...")
const express = require('express')

const app = express() //express is a middleware

app.use((req, resp, next) => {
    console.log('In middle ware...')
    next()
} )


app.use((req, resp, next) => {
    console.log('In another middle ware...')
    resp.send('Hello from out app')
} )

-> example /users before /users/add or /

Cart and CartItem deleted. We want to use an embedded document on the user object to store the cart

What are asynchronous requests

-> REST
CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
   -> when servers have to communicate with clients hosted in different environments
   -> We will need to tell our servers to allow such requests by modifying headers
OPTIONS Request -> Made by clients to see if the request will work with the options available.
